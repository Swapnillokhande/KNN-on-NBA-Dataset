# INTRODUCTION
The K Nearest Neighbor is a Supervised Machine Learning algorithm that is used to solve problems related to Classification and Regression. The algorithm works on the concept of the close proximity (neighbors) i.e. it assumes that the data points which are close to each other share similar properties, thus if any new data point occurs, the concept of KNN can be used to classify or compute a value based on its closeness with the other known data points (Harrison, 2018).

# PROBLEM STATEMENT
For the analysis, a dataset of new NBA players was which includes the prior statistics of the players. The goal is to predict whether the player would be able to make a career of atleast 5 years in the NBA. Here, the expected outcome of the solution is binary (0 or 1, Yes or No), thus it can be assumed that these are the two classes to which players belong i.e. players which will make a career of atleast 5 years belongs to the class of 1 and players which will have a career of less than 5 years belongs to the class of 0. Based on the outcome, it can be considered that the problem is a classification problem and thus the KNN algorithm to classify the outcome can be used.
